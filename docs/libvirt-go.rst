=======================
Libvirt Go Language API
=======================

The `Go <https://golang.org/>`__ package ``libvirt.org/libvirt-go`` provides
`CGo <https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/>`__ binding from the OS native Libvirt API.

In general the Go representation is a direct 1-1 mapping from native API
concepts to Go, so the native API documentation should serve as a reference
for most behaviour.

For details of Go specific behaviour consult the
`Go package documentation <https://pkg.go.dev/libvirt.org/libvirt-go>`__.
