#
# With this script you can run libvirt programs without needing to
# install them first.  You just have to do for example:
#
#   ./run virsh [args ...]
#
# Note that this runs the locally compiled copy of virsh which
# is usually want you want.
#
# You can also run the C programs under valgrind like this:
#
#   ./run valgrind [valgrind opts...] ./program
#
# or under gdb:
#
#   ./run gdb --args ./program
#
# This also works with sudo (eg. if you need root access for libvirt):
#
#   sudo ./run virsh list --all
