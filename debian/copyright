 PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate

 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.
 The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works.  The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license.  The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
 any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
