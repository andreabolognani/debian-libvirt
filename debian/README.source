This package is maintained with git-buildpackage(1). It follows
DEP-14 for branch naming (e.g. using debian/latest for the current
development target).

It uses pristine-tar(1) to store enough information in git to generate
bit identical tarballs when building the package without having
downloaded an upstream tarball first.

When working with patches it is recommended to use "gbp pq import" to
import the patches, modify the source and then use "gbp pq export
--commit" to commit the modifications.

The changelog is generated using "gbp dch" so if you submit any
changes don't bother to add changelog entries but rather provide
a nice git commit message that can then end up in the changelog.

It is recommended to build the package with pbuilder using:

    gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder

For information on how to set up a pbuilder environment see the
git-pbuilder(1) manpage. In short:

    DIST=sid git-pbuilder create
    gbp clone https://salsa.debian.org/libvirt-team/libvirt.git
    cd libvirt
    gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder

Some of the files in debian/ are generated from the corresponding
template in debian/templates/. Specifically, debian/control needs
to be regenerated after changes are made to its template: this can
be achieved by running

    debian/scripts/process-templates.py

and then committing both files. For all other files, templates are
processed at build time, so this additional step is unnecessary.
