Subject: qemu: domain: Fix logic when tainting domain

Originally the code was skipping all repeated taints with the same taint
flag but a logic bug introduced in commit 30626ed15b239c424ae inverted
the condition. This caused that actually the first occurence was NOT
logged but any subsequent was.

This was noticed when going through oVirt logs as they use custom guest
agent commands and the logs are totally spammed with this message.

Fixes: 30626ed15b239c424ae891f096057a696eadd715
